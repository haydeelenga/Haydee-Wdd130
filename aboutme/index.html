    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Haydee Lenga</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I am from DR Congo, and live in Accra Ghana with my mom and 3 of my siblings. I am the third born of my family. I speak French as my native language, and Enlish as a second langauge.</p>
    <p>I love the Lord so much and his church. I served my mission in The Ghana Kumasi Mission. And I am currently working as an ordinance worker in the Ghana Accra Temple.
    <p>I love music, dancing, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
    <p>I want to pursue a degree in software development and Web design.</p>
    <p>Thank you all for looking into my website. I am glad to come to know you all.</p>
